		<h1>My Spain Experience</h1>
		<p>
			<font size="3" color="purple">Visiting spain was a major life experience! I was able to visit 5 different cities 
			while i was there. My favorite city that i visited was Madrid. Madrid was so big and full of life and the people were so friendly.
			The food there was amazing and so different. I feel like there was so much culture in the way Spaniards eat.</font>
